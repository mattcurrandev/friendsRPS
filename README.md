## Overview
This project is a basic program that uses the python language to
simulate games of Rock Paper Scissors vs a computer. There is also
a cool reference to the TV show Friends.

## My process
First I began with creating the menu of the game asking the user 
to either select a move or quit the app. After that I created an
if steatment that would print the users move that they selected.
Next a number would be generated between 1-3 with random and 
that would select the computers move. Once the computers move
is selected another if statement was used to compare the users move
to the computers. After the outcome is decided the program lets you 
know if you won, loss or tied and then adds a tally to the record.
